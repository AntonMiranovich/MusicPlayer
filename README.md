# MusicPlayer
The project of a music player implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an interactive web application that allows users to play and manage their music collection.

This player has an attractive user interface designed with HTML and CSS. It includes controls such as play, pause, and rewind buttons.

JavaScript is the key programming language used in this project. It provides the functionality of the music player, including audio file loading, playback control, playlist management, and more.

Thanks to the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a convenient and powerful music player that users can use to enjoy their favorite music.
